# Optimization Models
Minimize or Maximize objectuve functions given constraints

# Knapsack Problem
Each item is represented by value and weight
Knapsack Weight w
Vector of length n representing every item
Vector of 0 or 1 of length n represented as V
1 representing item was taken
0 representing item was not taken

Find that sequence of 0s and 1s that maximize
Sum of i from 0 to n-1 : V[i]*I[i].value
subject to constraints
Sum of i from 0 to n-1 : V[i]*I[i].weight <= w

0/1 Knapsack
Fractional Knapsack

# Brute Force
Enumerate all possible combinations of sequence(Power Set)
Remove that sequence that total weight exceeds the w knapsack capacity
Remaining sequence, choose sequence with maximize value

# Greedy Algorithm
While there is space in knapsack capacity
Pick best available item that can be fitted in remaining space

Might get stuck at local optimal rather than global optimal

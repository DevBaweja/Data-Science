Stochastic Thinking
Ongoing process where next state depends upon previous state and randomness

God doesn't play dice

Probability of independent events occuring all at same time is equal to product of probability of each event occuring

Two events are independent if outcome of one event has no influence on outcome of other

Lots of trials to get good estimate of the frequency of occurrence of rare events

Sample probability are different from population probability

# Need of simulation

To simulate non solvable problems or exponential hard problems or mathematically intractable
Adjusting simulation is easy ie to bias probabilities
As events may not be equally likely to occur

# Random Walk
Stock Market, Modeling diffusion processes
Brownian Motion is random walk

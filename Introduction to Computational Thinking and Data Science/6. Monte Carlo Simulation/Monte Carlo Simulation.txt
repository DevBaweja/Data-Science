Monte Carlo Simulation
Estimating value of unknwon quantity using inferential statistics

Inferential Statistics
Population and Random Sample

Confidence depends upon
Size of sample
Variance of sample

As variance increases, larger size of sample is needed to predict that behaviour 

Law of Large Number
Repeating independent events having same probability p of a particular outcome in each test, the chance that the fraction of times that outcome occurs differs from p converges to zero as the number of trials goes to infinity
